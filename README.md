Bicycle
=======

I have so much pleasure in riding my own handmade bicycle that I want to share the way I did it.

### Design a bike that fits your body

Framebuilding isn't knew and some books are explaining the process. Among them, the [patereck](http://www.amazon.com/The-Paterek-manual-bicycle-framebuilders/dp/B000711OC0) which can be find free of charge [here](http://www.timpaterek.com/paterek.pdf), is the one I used.
